    "NSM Hamiltonians are many-body Hamiltonians represented in a single particle framework (or nucleon modes) described by Valence orbitals (with the famous set of quantum numbers that describe the 3D harmonic oscillator $|n,l,j,m,t,t_z\\rangle$. The last two quantum numbers describe the isospin of the nucleons (proton or neutron).\n",
